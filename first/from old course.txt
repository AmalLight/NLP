 dt = pdf = study for distribution of set X == density               PDF = Density of X
      result by percentage % about set X
      will be useful rember that with CAMPANA
      Study Probability: Pdf = P(X)

 pt = Cumulative Distribution                                        CDF = Like Integral on Fx
      result percentage % using Fx                                    Fx = model = Codominio
      integral using Fx
      will be useful rember that with ESSE
      Study Probability: Cdf = P(<=X)
      
 * pt is a family for get a model for have percentage % result .
 * Alternative integral to pt make a cdf function:
   CDF = % --> median or 50th percentile CDF ( x ) = 0.5
                         50th percentile = x 

 qt = Quantile Function
      result Fx using cdf ( return to original Codominio = model )
      derivate of integral pt , inverse for pt ! e dt ?
      will be useful rember that with ESSE CAPOVOLTA
